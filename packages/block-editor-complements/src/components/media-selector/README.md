# MediaSelector component

This component enhances a block that has been defined as a [media source consumer](../../hooks/connect/Readme.md).

## Block - Editor canvas changes

Initially, when a block is inserted it doesn't have defined any media source. The block will show the Media Selector placeholder, which provides the user a way to link it with a media or skip this step for later.
